                <h1>About Peter Pan</h1>
                <p>
                    Peter Pan is an AI prototype that has one goal: help people
                    frictionlessly manage their blood glucose levels through
                    multiple means, making long healthspan and high energy
                    accessible for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be asking: "Why blood glucose? What does sugar
                    have to do with my health, precisely?" It's simple: many
                    negative effects on health (from small problems like fat
                    gain or energy crashs to diseases like diabetes) stem from
                    energy mismanagement.
                </p>
                <img
                    class="image"
                    src="{{ url_for('static', filename='glucose_curve.webp') }}"
                />
                <p>
                    It all has to do with glucose curves. When you eat food, the
                    carbohydrates are coverted into glucose, which is sent
                    through your blood. Over time, this glucose is consumed by
                    your cells using insulin and the curve drops. However, when
                    the glucose curve is above a certain amount, your body can't
                    use it all and instead converts it into stored fat. These
                    high points of glucose result in "spikes" that eventually
                    crash to low glucose, which you experience as an energy
                    crash and feeling awful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volatile, "spiky" glucose curves can cause people to develop
                    diseases over time, such as diabetes mellitus. Arguably
                    worse, these spikes also cause advanced glycation
                    end-products (AGEs) to form in your blood. AGEs stuff up the
                    bloodstream and build plaque, which eventually becomes
                    cardiovascular disease and heart difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, for healthy, energetic day-to-day life and a long,
                    healthy lifespan, Peter Pan is here to help!
